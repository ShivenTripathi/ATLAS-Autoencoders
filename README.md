# ATLAS-Autoencoders-Evaluation

"An AE is a neural network which tries to implement an approximation to the identity, f(x) â‰ˆ x, by using one or more hidden layers with smaller size than the input and output layers. 

The idea is then to only save this smaller hidden layer representation instead of the current data format, along with the neural network that can recreate the original data." [1]
